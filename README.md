Project Idea
Data Engineering: Build Large custom datasets by implementing fetcher and preprocessing  units to periodically
retieve data from various sources using python and pandas . Implement and maintain a robust and dynamic PostgresSQL 
database using SQLAlchemy

Neural Network Modelling : Develop UNET object detection and for detecting defects on wafers using Pytorch 

Implement Reward Constrained Policy Optimization (RCPO) into stable baseline3 implementation
of proximal policy optimization (ppo) using pytorch

Q and A:
1. Why are regularization techniques useful in generational models 
- Prevent overfitting and improve model's ability to generalize to new data 
- dropout -> Disables some neurons during training , focrcing model to rely on mutiple features 

- weight decay -> Penalizes large weights - ensuring simpler and more general features are learned 
- spectral normalization ->
